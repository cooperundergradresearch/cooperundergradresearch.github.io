## Cooper Union Undergraduate Research Symposium
Cooper Union Undergraduate Research Club led by Sangjoon (Bob) Lee and Naomi Akiyama serves to promote academic research for Cooper Union undergraduate students. We plan to achieve the goal by organizing an annual Cooper Union Undergraduate Research Symposium event which brings students and faculty advisors to present their work at the Rose Auditorium.
